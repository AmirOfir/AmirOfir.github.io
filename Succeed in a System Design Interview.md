I will be examined in an interview regarding how components connect and interface.\
Facebook shifted their main concern so the educative.io focus is in the wrong area.

Keynotes from FB coordinator:
1.    I need to lead the interview and not to wait or expect interviewer guiding questions.
2.    Need to look 2 steps forward to know where I am heading
3.    Manage my time in the interview efficiently
4.    Place a script ("timetable") near the screen
5.    Main concern is how I dreal with systems I don't know and how I receive demands (specs)
6.    Need to practice with a whiteboard

Time Table:
1.    10m Problem exploration: Question whatever needed. why do we build it and for what? What do we want to solve? Who will use it? Concrete data, scale
2.    10m Drawing / Drafting: Each component purpose, how the data will pass
3.    10m pick an area and talk about it: Matrices (How to analyse its usage), Testing (How to analyse its behaviour), What is the main concern, drill in.
4.    10m How does it work end-to-end. Disscussion on the entire system. Why will it work. What is my added value? Why are we using this database and whats is pros and cons. Create a discussion on tradeoffs regarding the tools. I am picking this solution as this is its advantage over others. 
5.    5m What happens if the requirements change
